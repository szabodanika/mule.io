# Mule.io

Mule.io is a light weight event-driven socket communication framework written in Java. It can be used in various environments, currently mostly usable as a quick but appropriate solution for small-scale projects in need of safe server-client communication.

- Mule.io uses AES and RSA for hybrid encryption, communication is both secure and fast. Also modifying the client does not let you connect to the server without authorization
- Event-driven messaging makes development easier. You can set ID's for different kind of messages that helps you create your own message handler
- Super simple configuration for your  server and client
